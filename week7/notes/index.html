        <h3>call() method</h3>
        <p> Can be used to set the value of 'this' inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument<br/>
            Example:<br/><br/>
            function greet(){ return `Hello, my name's ${this.name}`;}
            <br/>
            <br/>
            const batman = {name : 'Bruce'};
            const spiderman = {name : 'Peter'};
            <br/>
            <br/>
            greet.call(batman); << 'Bruce'
            <br/>
            greet.call(spiderman): << 'Peter'
            <br/>
            <br/>
            if the function had arguments, they would be added after the object argument: greet.call(spiderman, arg1, arg2...);
            <br/>
            if we needed to use arrays as the additional arguments, we'd use apply instead of call: greet.apply(spiderman, [arg1], [arg2]);<br/>
            this method is not necessary in ES6 because we can simply use the spread operator to add values as arrays: greet.call(spiderman, ...[arg1], ...[arg2])
            <br/>
            <br/>
            if function does not refer to an object we can still use call, place null as the first argument: functionName.call(null, arg1);
        </p>
        <h3>Adding Properties to Functions</h3>

        <p>Once functions have been defined, properties can be added, just as in class objects: <br/><br/>
            function naming(name){
                return `Your name is: ${name}`;
            }

            naming.description = 'This function tells you what your name is, but you need to give it your name first :P';<br/><br/>
        
            naming(Steven); << Your name is: Steven<br/><br/>
            naming.description; << 'This function tells you what your name is, but you need to give it your name first :P'
        <br/> 
        </p> 
            
        <h3>Memoization</h3>
        
        <p>

        This technique is used to create result caching. When a funtion takes a long time complete and return a result, you can store the result so that it
        can be used in the future for future call of the same function with the same argument value. <br/><br/>
        example: function square(x){ <br/>
            square.cache = square.cache || {}<br/>
            if(!square.cache[x]){<br/>
                square.cache[x] = x*x;<br/>
            }<br/><br/>
            return square.cache[x];<br/>
        }<br/><br/>
        square(2); << 4<br/>
        square(3); << 9<br/>
        square.cache; << {'2':4, '3':9}
        </p> 

       <h3>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions: IIFE(pronounced 'effy')</h3>
        <p>
            An anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it is defined.<br/>
            This is done by placing parenthesis around the function and another pair after closing the parenthesis:<br/><br/>
            (function(){ return "Howdy partner!;"})(); << 'Howdy Partner!'<br/><br/>
            This is a great way to use variables that will only be needed once throughout the program, in order to keep namespace unpolluted.<br/><br/>
            It is also a great way to add your code in strict mode wheere the mode of the code that already exists is unknown: <br/>
            (function(){
                'use strict';
                code block...
            })(); only the code block will be in strict mode<br/><br/>
            IFFE can also be used to create blocks of code with their own scope within the same program so they cannot interfere with each other.
            In ES6, there is no need for IIFE. You can simply enclose your code in curly braces and the same result is returned
        
        </p>

        <h3>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h3>
        <p>
            This is done by assigning a anonymouse function to a variable with the same name as the fucntion:<br/><br/>
            function happy(){<br/>
                console.log('Wow this is it!');<br/>
                happy = function(){<br/>
                    console.log('This is happening!');<br/>
                };<br/>
            }<br/><br/>
            The first call will return the initial defined value, and all subsequent calls will return the redefined value:<br/><br/>
            happy(); << 'Wow this is it!'<br/>
            happy(); << 'This is happening'<br/>
            happy(); << 'This is happening'<br/><br/>
            Any property added prior to the first call and onwards will be lost as shown below:<br/><br/>

            function test(){<br/>
                console.log('First Attempt In Learning');<br/>
                test = function(){<br/>
                    console.log('PASS');<br/>
                };<br/>
            }<br/><br/>
            test.music = 'Opera';<br/>
            test.music; << Opera<br/><br/>
            test(); << 'First Attempt In Learning'<br/>
            test.music; << undefined<br/><br/>
            test(); << 'PASS'<br/>
        </p>
    </body>
