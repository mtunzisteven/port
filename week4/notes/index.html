        <h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
        
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p> We can access the form in JS using the following line: const varNameForForm = document.forms['FormNameAttribute'][index];<br/>
        Without an index, an array of all forms in the document is returned.<br/> Forms index is based on order of appearance in the html document</p>
        <p> We can add an event listener the the form using the forllowing line: varNameForForm.addEventListener('submit', functionName, false); </p>
        <p> <strong>function</strong><br/>
        
            Declare function: function functionName(event) {...<br/><br/>

            When a form is submitted, we use event.preventDefault(); to ensure that it doesn't get submitted. This would be beneficial in AJax submitions. 
            This can be added inside the function which holds the code and logic for the event.<br/>
            
        <br/> 
        To get an input element within the form we can use one of the two ways: <br/> 

        <strong>1. </strong>let varNameForInput = varNameForForm['inputAttrName']; <br/>
        <strong>2. </strong>let varNameForInput = event.target['inputAttrName']; <br/></p>


            It is also possible to find out the index of the option that has been selected, 
            using the selectedIndex property. For example, if a user selected 'Gotham City' 
            from the menu, form2.city.selectedIndex would return 2 because itâ€™s the third option 
            in the list. This can then be used to access the actual text contained in the 
            selected option:
            
            event.target.options[event.target.selectedIndex].text

        <p>
            To access checked input elements from a checkbox list:<br/>
            let varNameForArrayOfInputs = [...event.target.['inputAttrName']].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value); <br/>
            <br/>

            This uses the spread operator to turn the node list into an array. This then 
            allows us to use the filter() method that returns an array containing only the 
            check boxes that were checked (this is because their 'checked' property will be 
            truthy). We then chain the map() method to the end, which replaces each checkbox 
            in the array with its 'value' property. This array is then returned and stored 
            in the hero.powers variable.<br /><br />
