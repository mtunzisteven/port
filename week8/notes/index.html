        <h2>Transforms</h2>

        <p> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
            any element. We use transofrm functions to manipulate the appearance of an element. The value of the transform is one or more transofrm functions seperated by spaces. The fucntions are applied in the order they appear.</p>
        
        <h3>translate()</h3>
        <p> This fucntion is used to move an element along the x and y axis. It is applied as shown in the following example:</p>
        <p class='example'> transform: translate(x,y); <br/> transform: translateX(x); <br/> transform: translateY(y);</p>
        <p> Transforms don't work on inline elements. Convert inline elements to "inline-block".</p>

        <h3>scale()</h3>
        <p> This fucntion is used to scale an element along the x and y axis. When only one value is provided without specifying the axis, the element is scaled while the aspect ratio is maintained. The center of the element is always maintained.It is applied as shown in the following example:</p>
        <p class='example'> transform: scale(x,y); <br/> transform: translateX(x); <br/> transform: translateY(y);<br/> transform: scale(v); <br/></p>
                            transform: translate(x,y) scale(x,y); </p>

        <h3>rotate()</h3>
        <p> To rotate elements on their point of origin, we use the rotate function. we specify the values in degrees(deg). Positive rotates elements clock-wise, while negative rotates elements anti-clock-wise.</p>

        <p> In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns</p> 

        <p class='example'> transform: rotate(Vdeg); <br/> transform: rotate(Vdeg) translate(x,y) scale(V);</p>

        <h3>skew()</h3>
        <p> This fucntion is used to skew an element along the x and y axis. It is applied as shown in the following example:</p>
        <p class='example'> transform: skew(x,y); <br/> transform: skew(x.y) rotate(Vdeg) translate(x,y) scale(V);</p>

        <h3>transform-origin</h3>
        <p> This fucntion is used to change the origin of an element. It has similar syntax as background-position property. It is applied as shown in the following example:</p>
        <p class='example'> transform-origin: x% y%; <br/> transform: skew(x.y) rotate(Vdeg) translate(x,y) scale(V);</p>


        <p> Transforms don't cause document reflow, therefore, none of the elements neighboring the transformed element will accomodate the transformation. Keep this in mind.</p>

        <h2>Transitions</h2>
        <p> Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time. They are used to create animations. All transforms above can be animated.
            CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element. Whenever the target properties change, the browser will apply the 
            transition making the change gradual.
        </p>

        <h4>Steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</h4>
        <p> 1. Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.<br/>
            2. Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.<br/>
            3. Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the<br/><br/>
            transition properties, including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, 
            and transition-delay.</p>

        <h3>transition-property</h3>

        <p> The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.</p>

        <p>Any property changing from one value to another for which you can find a valid
            midpoint can be transitioned. For example, in transitioning from a 1px red border
            to a 15px blue border, we transition the color and width of the border.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to include a pre-state and a post-state. For example, to transition
            from rectangular corners to rounded corners, set the original state to border-radius: 0;.
            From the above examples, we can use it in the following way: 
        </p>

        <p class='example'> transition-property: transform; <br/>
            transition-property: transform, color;
        </p>

        <h3>transition-duration</h3>

        <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the
            duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state. You
            can specify this either in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). 
            any duration lower-than 200ms makes the website seem slow. Anything faster may be too quick to see.
            To specify 0.2 seconds (0.2s), or 200 milliseconds (200ms) we use the following:
        </p>

        <p class='example'> transition-duration: 0.2s;</p>

        <h3>transition-timing-function</h3>

        <p>The transition-timing function properties set the pace of the transition. they have key therms:<br/><br/>
            ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out. The default is ease.
        </p>

        <p class='example'> transition-timing-function: ease-out;</p>

        <h3>transition-delay property</h3>

        <p>The transition-delay properties is used to add a delay before a transition begins. The default
            is 0. Use ms or s to specify the delay.
        </p>

        <p class='example'> transition-timing-function: ease-out;</p>
